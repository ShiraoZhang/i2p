## How We Are Running Things...

- **PREPARATION**: READINGS, pre-recorded LECTURES, contributuons to a weekly 'Padlet'
- **WORKSHOPS**: Reviewing questions and issues arising from the previous week's PRACTICAL session. Your input to the 'Padlet' will guide the first half of each week's 'workshop'. READINGS and weekly topic group-discussions. The second half will be 'live coding' in an **I do/We do** format.
- **PRACTICALS**: A mix of lectured and self-led exercises of weekly programming.
